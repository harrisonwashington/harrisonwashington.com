         <section id="about-me"> <h2>About</h2> <p>
               I am a results-driven IT Specialist with over 6 years of hands-on experience in managing and optimizing diverse IT environments. My expertise spans network administration, cloud infrastructure (GCP, Azure), cybersecurity, and comprehensive IT support. I am passionate about leveraging technology to enhance operational efficiency, strengthen security postures, and resolve complex technical challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
               My background includes proven success in implementing and maintaining critical systems, including Windows Server, Microsoft 365, and endpoint protection solutions like CrowdStrike Falcon. I am skilled in automating routine tasks using scripting (e.g., PowerShell) and have a strong track record of resolving hardware, software, and network-related issues for end users.
            </p>
            <p>
               Beyond technical skills, I pride myself on clear communication, effective planning, and robust problem-solving abilities. I have experience leading IT projects and collaborating with cross-functional teams to align IT strategies with broader business objectives. I am dedicated to continuous learning and applying best practices to ensure reliable, secure, and high-performing IT operations.
